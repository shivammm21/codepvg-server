# Email-Only Authentication Changes

## Overview
Modified the authentication system to use email-only login instead of username + email. This simplifies the user experience by removing the need for users to remember a separate username.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserRegistrationDto
- **Removed**: `username` field and validation
- **Updated**: Constructor to not require username
- **Result**: Users only need to provide email, password, and other profile details

### 2. LoginDto
- **Changed**: `username` field to `email`
- **Updated**: Validation message and constructor
- **Result**: Login now uses email + password instead of username + password

### 3. UserService
- **Removed**: Username uniqueness check in `registerUser()`
- **Added**: Auto-generation of username from email (part before @)
- **Added**: Logic to handle username conflicts by appending numbers
- **Result**: Username is automatically created from email, ensuring uniqueness

### 4. AuthController
- **Updated**: Login endpoint to use `findByEmail()` instead of `findByUsername()`
- **Updated**: JWT token generation to use email as the subject
- **Updated**: Status endpoint path from `/status/{username}` to `/status/{email}`
- **Updated**: Error messages to reference "email" instead of "username"

### 5. Documentation Updates
- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Updated all examples to show email-only registration and login
- **QUICK_TEST_COMMANDS.md**: Updated test commands to use email instead of username

## How It Works Now

### Registration Process
1. User provides: email, password, fullName, year, branch, prnNumber, mobileNumber, role
2. System automatically generates username from email (e.g., "john.doe@college.edu" â†’ "john.doe")
3. If username already exists, system appends numbers (e.g., "john.doe1", "john.doe2")
4. User is registered with auto-generated username but only needs to remember email

### Login Process
1. User provides: email + password
2. System looks up user by email
3. Validates password and account status
4. Returns JWT token with email as the subject

### Benefits
- **Simpler UX**: Users only need to remember their email and password
- **No username conflicts**: System handles username generation automatically
- **Familiar pattern**: Most modern apps use email-only authentication
- **Backward compatible**: Username still exists internally for system operations

## Test the Changes

### Register a new user (no username needed):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@college.edu",
    "password": "password123",
    "fullName": "New User",
    "year": "2nd Year",
    "branch": "Computer Science",
    "prnNumber": "PRN123456789",
    "mobileNumber": "9876543210",
    "role": "student"
  }'
```

### Login with email:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@college.edu",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### Check status by email:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/status/newuser@college.edu" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000"
```

## Migration Notes
- Existing users with usernames can still login using the email they registered with
- The username field is still maintained internally for database consistency
- JWT tokens now use email as the subject instead of username
